# Why did you make this?
#### My family is extended across the globe. A major inspiration to this is my friends from all over the world who I have met and plan to travel to see. I wanted to make a plugin which incorporated my friends and the languages that they speak so I sent them messages asking for random texts in the langauges they knew and this is what they came back with.

How do we know that rain isn't tears falling from sad clouds? They could be but you've never asked a cloud, have you? Birds fly but ostriches can‚Äôt and they are birds. I wonder if there is a reason behind that. I really like days where it rains all day, it is super relaxing. Birds actually fly backward which means that planes do the same. You should listen to music instead of eating. It makes you feel better.

Os paxari√±os das √°rbores fican os xornais onde xente de Nova Iork come maz√°s cun coitelo dourado. A mi√±a nai come eses paxari√±os cando ningu√©n est√° a mirar, eu penso que √© razoable seica o canibalismo √© ilegal (penso eu). O meu irm√°n de acollida ten un burato nos seus pantal√≥ns. O can l√°dralle √°s catro da ma√±√° para que esperte.
### Which translates to 
The little birds on the trees look at the newspapers where people from New York eat apples with a golden knife. My mom eats those little birds when no one looks, I think it's reasonable although cannibalism it's illegal (I think). My host brother has red hair and his pants have a hole in them. The dog barks at him at 4 AM so he wakes up.

Solamente necesito tomar cereales con leche. El queso est√° bueno, y tambi√©n lo est√°n las galletas. Me encanta mojar mis nachos en chocolate.

Blommor doftar gott. Flingor med mj√∂lk √§r inte gott, flingor √§r bara gott med filmj√∂lk. Hundar √§r mycket b√§ttre √§n katter men b√§sta djuret av alla m√•ste √§nd√• vara valrossar. Rosor √§r r√∂da violer √§r bl√• jag gillar himmelen med moln p√•. Go och glad kexchoklad. Svensk godis √§r det b√§sta som finns skulle kunna √§ta ihj√§l mig p√• sura skallar. Nu vattnas min mun bara f√∂r att jag skrev det.
### Which translates to 
Flowers smell good. Cereal with milk is disgusting, cereal is only good with sour youghurt. Dogs are better than cats but the best animal of all has to be walruses.

Now my mouth is watering just because I wrote that.
