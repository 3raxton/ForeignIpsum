## About

My family is extended across the globe. A major inspiration for Foreign Ipsum is my friends and family all over the world. I wanted to make a plugin which incorporated the languages they spoke so I sent them messages asking for random texts in the languages they knew. With their replies, Foreign Ipsum's content is what they came back with.

## English ‚Äî [Braxton](http://instagram.com/3raxton)
#### What did Braxton write?
How do we know that rain isn't tears falling from sad clouds? They could be but you've never asked a cloud, have you? Birds fly but ostriches can‚Äôt and they are birds. I wonder if there is a reason behind that. I really like days where it rains all day, it is super relaxing. Birds actually fly backward which means that planes do the same. You should listen to music instead of eating. It makes you feel better.

### What did Silvia write?
Os paxari√±os das √°rbores fican os xornais onde xente de Nova Iork come maz√°s cun coitelo dourado. A mi√±a nai come eses paxari√±os cando ningu√©n est√° a mirar, eu penso que √© razoable seica o canibalismo √© ilegal (penso eu). O meu irm√°n de acollida ten un burato nos seus pantal√≥ns. O can l√°dralle √°s catro da ma√±√° para que esperte.
### Which translates to 
The little birds on the trees look at the newspapers where people from New York eat apples with a golden knife. My mom eats those little birds when no one looks, I think it's reasonable although cannibalism it's illegal (I think). My host brother has red hair and his pants have a hole in them. The dog barks at him at 4 AM so he wakes up.

Mi piace nuotare. Nessuno dovrebbe mettere il formaggio sul pesce perch√© √® disgustoso. Mi piace l'estate. Odio la pioggia. La pizza italiana √® la migliore e tutti dovrebbero provarla. Adoro il gelato. Ascoltare la musica √® la cosa migliore per rilassarsi.

#### What did Cami write?
Eu gosto de escutar m√∫sica enquanto me arrumo para sair. Eu n√£o gosto de voc√™. Eu gosto de voc√™. Eu tenho que lavar meu cabelo. Essa garota que est√° cantando tem uma voz bonita.

## Spanish ‚Äî [Silvia](http://instagram.com/silvia_grana)
### What did Silvia write?
Solamente necesito tomar cereales con leche. El queso est√° bueno, y tambi√©n lo est√°n las galletas. Me encanta mojar mis nachos en chocolate. Las bufandas son √∫tiles para mantenerte caliente, tambi√©n tienen estilo. Solo necesito tirarme desde un avi√≥n con una bufanda para no coger un catarro. Mi perro es negro, mi rata es blanca. Mis padres quieren que tenga un hijo. El colegio es √∫til si te quieres morir.

## Swedish ‚Äî [Ilse](https://www.instagram.com/ilse.richardson/)

#### What did Ilse write?
Blommor doftar gott. Flingor med mj√∂lk √§r inte gott, flingor √§r bara gott med filmj√∂lk. Hundar √§r mycket b√§ttre √§n katter men b√§sta djuret av alla m√•ste √§nd√• vara valrossar. Rosor √§r r√∂da violer √§r bl√• jag gillar himmelen med moln p√•. Go och glad kexchoklad. Svensk godis √§r det b√§sta som finns skulle kunna √§ta ihj√§l mig p√• sura skallar. Nu vattnas min mun bara f√∂r att jag skrev det.
#### Which translates to:
Flowers smell good. Cereal with milk is disgusting, cereal is only good with sour youghurt. Dogs are better than cats but the best animal of all has to be walruses. Roses are red vilots are blue I like skies with clouds on. Happy and nice kexchoklad. Swedish candy is the best thing in the world, I could die eating sour skulls. Now my mouth is watering just because I wrote that.
## Turkish ‚Äî [Ahmet Ozan](https://www.instagram.com/ahmetozantekin/)
#### What did Ozan write?
Karabiberim vur kadehlere hadi i√ßelim, i√ßelim her gece. Zevki sefa doldu g√∂nl√ºme. Hadi i√ßelim acƒ±larƒ±n yerine. Buralara yaz g√ºn√º kar yaƒüƒ±yor canƒ±m √∂lene kadar seni bekleyemem. Ona buna benzemem oyuna gelmem senin i√ßin √∂lmeye s√∂z veremem.
#### Which translates to:
Shake my peas Let's drink by the glasses, drink every night. Pleasure is full of pleasure. Let's drink instead of your aches. It's snowing on a summer's day I can not wait for you until I die. I can not promise to die for you if I do not come to the game like this to him. Great poet Serdar Orta√ß.
