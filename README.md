# Why did you make this?
My family is extended across the globe. A major inspiration to this is my friends from all over the world who I have met and plan to travel to see. I wanted to make a plugin which incorporated my friends and the languages that they speak so I sent them messages asking for random texts in the languages they knew and this is what they came back with.

How do we know that rain isn't tears falling from sad clouds? They could be but you've never asked a cloud, have you? Birds fly but ostriches can‚Äôt and they are birds. I wonder if there is a reason behind that. I really like days where it rains all day, it is super relaxing. Birds actually fly backward which means that planes do the same. You should listen to music instead of eating. It makes you feel better.

Os paxari√±os das √°rbores fican os xornais onde xente de Nova Iork come maz√°s cun coitelo dourado. A mi√±a nai come eses paxari√±os cando ningu√©n est√° a mirar, eu penso que √© razoable seica o canibalismo √© ilegal (penso eu). O meu irm√°n de acollida ten un burato nos seus pantal√≥ns.

### Which translates to 
The little birds on the trees look at the newspapers where people from New York eat apples with a golden knife.

The dog barks at him at 4 AM so he wakes up.

Titrwm, tatrwm, Gwen lliw'r wy, Lliw'r meillion mwy rwy'n curo, Mae'r gwynt yn oer oddi ar y llyn. O flodyn y dyffryn deffro. Chwyth y t√¢n, mi gynnith toc, Mae hi'n ddrycinog heno. Os ymhell o'm gwlad yr af. Pa beth a wnaf a'm geneth? Pa run a'i mynd a hi efo mi Ai gadael hi mewn hiraeth? Hedd fy nghalon o bob man. I fryniau a phantiau Pentraeth. Weithiau'n Llundain, weithiau yng Nghaer. Yn gweithio'n daer amdani, Weithiau yn gwasgu fy mun mewn cell. Ac weithiau ymhell oddi wrthi: Mi gofleidiwn flodau'r rhos Pe bawn i'n agos ati. Titrwm, tatrwm, Gwen lliw'r wy, Lliw'r meillion mwy rwy'n curo, Mae'r gwynt yn oer oddi ar y llyn. O flodyn y dyffryn deffro. Chwyth y t√¢n, mi gynnith toc, Mae hi'n ddrycinog heno.
### Which translates to 
Pitter patter, White the colour of egg, The colour of the clover I beat more, The wind is cold from the lakeside, Oh flower of the awakened valley.Blow the fire, I have a slice, It's prickly tonight. If I'm far from the land I came from What will I do with my girl? Should I bring her with me And leave her with homesickness? Peace in my heart from every place To the hills and steams of Pentraeth Sometimes in London, sometimes in Caer Working desperately for her Sometimes finding myself in a cell And sometimes far from her I'd present her with roses If I was near to her Pitter patter, White the colour of egg, The colour of the clover I beat more, The wind is cold from the lakeside,Oh flower of the awakened valley. Blow the fire, I have a slice, It's prickly tonight.
